					<description><![CDATA[Summary: the unbanning of  Food Chain, Imperial Seal, and Griselbrand, alongside the return of Leovold, Emissary of Trest as a legal commander.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Unban</strong></h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Food Chain</strong></li>



<li><strong>Limited Resources</strong></li>



<li><strong>Imperial Seal</strong></li>



<li><strong>Griselbrand</strong></li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Unban as Commander</strong></h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Leovold, Emissary of Trest</strong></li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Remove from Watchlist</strong></h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Goblin Recruiter</strong></li>



<li><strong>Haldan, Avid Arcanist</strong></li>



<li><strong>Isochron Scepter</strong></li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Add to Watchlist</strong></h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Dihada, Binder of Wills</strong></li>



<li><strong>Gifts Ungiven</strong></li>



<li><strong>Food Chain</strong></li>



<li><strong>Leovold, Emissary of Trest</strong></li>



<li><strong>Limited Resources</strong></li>



<li><strong>Imperial Seal</strong></li>



<li><strong>Griselbrand</strong></li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Unban Details</strong></h3>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Food Chain</strong></h4>



<p><em>Yep, we’ve finally done it.</em> We decided that Food Chain is an interesting and powerful card and that we want to see if it is a good fit for Conquest as it stands now. Being commander-centric generally, functioning with otherwise niche cards, and being a slightly harder-than-average card type to tutor outside of white are all points in the card’s favor. As is standard procedure now, it is also being placed on the watchlist and will definitely be watched closely.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Limited Resources</strong></h4>



<p>Reviewing the list for cards that could possibly be unbanned, basically everyone agreed that there wasn’t really a strong reason for this to remain banned. Historically, players have complained about certain land-oriented strategies feeling like they lack meaningful counterplay beyond simply going over their heads, and the hope is this card could offer some of that and empower stax, which is a struggling archetype.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Imperial Seal</strong></h4>



<p>Another long-requested unban, the decision of the team was that the combination of its sorcery-speed and top-deck tutoring made it acceptable for the Conquest format. This will definitely be a card we are watching to see if unbanning it alongside two new combo pieces is an error.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Griselbrand</strong></h4>



<p>Griselbrand was grandfathered into a Conquest ban, but the estimation of the team is that reduced life totals, more punishing mana bases, a format with more combat on average, and a lack of fast mana to draw into will all help balance him. Reanimator as an archetype is dwindling, and we hope this could revitalize it.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Unban as Commander</strong></h3>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Leovold, Emissary of Trest</strong></h4>



<p>Evaluating Leovold, another grandfathered-in ban, we decided that while in the modern metagame he remained a strong disruption and value piece, the deck is not actually likely to be a serious menace due to not presenting a clear win con, and that the Sultai color combination is underrepresented in the format. This is another one we will be watching closely.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Remove from Watchlist</strong></h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Goblin Recruiter</strong></li>



<li><strong>Haldan, Avid Arcanist</strong></li>



<li><strong>Isochron Scepter</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>The team judged that these cards are not problematic right now and do not need to be watched anymore. Recruiter’s problem deck (Muxus) was hit by Vault, Haldan just isn’t the boogeyman he was, and Scepter is a somewhat awkward combo.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Add to Watchlist</strong></h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Dihada, Binder of Wills</strong></li>



<li><strong>Gifts Ungiven</strong></li>



<li><strong>Food Chain</strong></li>



<li><strong>Leovold, Emissary of Trest</strong></li>



<li><strong>Limited Resources</strong></li>



<li><strong>Imperial Seal</strong></li>



<li><strong>Griselbrand</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Beyond the obvious (recently unbanned cards), we are adding Dihada and Gifts Ungiven to the watchlist due to both of their high potential to quickly conclude games. Dihada in particular is shaping up to be one of the top commanders, and Gifts is a very strong and versatile wincon package finder. We will be continuing to evaluate them closely.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Updated Watchlist (January 2025)</strong></h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Ancient Tomb</strong></li>



<li><strong>Cyclonic Rift</strong></li>



<li><strong>Deflecting Swat</strong></li>



<li><strong>Dihada, Binder of Wills</strong></li>



<li><strong>Eldritch Evolution</strong></li>



<li><strong>Fierce Guardianship</strong></li>



<li><strong>Food Chain</strong></li>



<li><strong>Gifts Ungiven</strong></li>



<li><strong>Glint-Horn Buccaneer</strong></li>

</ul>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Banned Cards</strong></h3>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>All Cards with Stickers or Attractions</strong></h4>



<p>Wizards of the Coast banned these cards from all sanctioned formats in May 2024 due to their problematic design. The Conquest balance team has followed suit. (<a href="https://shorturl.at/kChtk">Full List</a>)</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Nadu, Winged Wisdom (Banned as Commander)</strong></h4>



<p>Nadu has dominated Magic formats with win rates over 40%, consistently winning by turn 3 or establishing oppressive board states. Community feedback and team consensus determined that Nadu’s oppressive nature warranted a ban as a commander.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Unbanned Cards</strong></h3>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Eldritch Evolution (Moved to Watch List)</strong></h4>



<p>Previously banned to curb green’s dominance, Eldritch Evolution returns as green has become one of the weaker colors in Conquest. The card will be closely monitored on the watchlist.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Isochron Scepter (Moved to Watch List)</strong></h4>



<p>Once banned to discourage cEDH-style combos, Isochron Scepter is returning as the metagame has evolved, with higher power levels and more answers. It provides new opportunities for control and combo decks.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Haldan, Avid Arcanist (Moved to Watch List)</strong></h4>



<p>Haldan &amp; Pako return after years of absence. The team believes they now align with the current metagame and power levels. Their performance will be observed to ensure balance.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Watch List Updates</strong></h3>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Added</strong></h4>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Eldritch Evolution</strong></li>



<li><strong>Isochron Scepter</strong></li>



<li><strong>Urza, Lord High Artificer</strong>: Urza’s synergy with Isochron Scepter and artifact mana makes him a potential concern.</li>



<li><strong>Haldan, Avid Arcanist</strong></li>
</ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Removed</strong></h4>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Esper Sentinel</strong>: Powerful but manageable compared to cards like Rhystic Study.</li>



<li><strong>Time Sieve</strong>: While monitored alongside Tivit, the issue lies more with the commander than this combo piece.</li>



<li><strong>Burgeoning</strong> and <strong>Exploration</strong>: Their unbanning has not disrupted the format.</li>
</ul>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Updated Watch List (July 2024)</strong></h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Remembering Sheldon Menery (1961-2023)</strong></h3>



<p>We would be remiss to begin this update without paying respects to our forefather in the pastime, Sheldon Menery, who passed away in September 2023. In addition to being an early endorser of the Conquest format, Sheldon was a titan in the world of Magic judging and Commander, and an all-around great human being. His presence will be sorely missed, but his impact will remain.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Welcoming Mateus Nogueira to the Balance Team</strong></h3>



<p>Congratulations to Mateus on being appointed to the Conquest Balance Team! His leadership in the online and Brazilian spaces has given new life to our format. He has an eye for new strategies and a great sense of humor, and he is already a staunch advocate and executive member of our staff. His contributions are included in this balance update.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Update Introduction</strong></h3>



<p>The Conquest Balance team is happy to announce today its first update since June 2022, and first changes to the ban list since December 2021. This update comes on the heels of a couple of years of organized Conquest play, especially in Brazil, but also internationally online and in home playgroups. We appreciate the community’s patience with this update and look forward to seeing how the format shifts and evolves in this update’s wake.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Mana Vault is Banned</strong></h3>



<p>Long the most divisive card in Conquest, Mana Vault has provided explosive and exploitable mana to many Conquest decks throughout the format&#8217;s history. Fast mana tends to benefit decks that want to execute an efficient combo more often than it helps other strategies, disrupting the goal of archetypal balance across the format. Conquest&#8217;s Scry Rule accentuates the issues with cheap, artifact-based mana and the ways luck can warp games early. Fast mana in general does have a place in the Conquest format, but Mana Vault&#8217;s downsides are often negligible for the decks that want to manipulate it the most. Notably, the majority opinion expressed in the June 2023 survey was to ban Mana Vault. For these reasons, this long-held watch list item is a logical addition to the ban list.</p>



<p>The Balance team looks forward to a format without Mana Vault, and will continue to observe and seek feedback concerning the effect of fast mana in the format. In the meantime, Conquest still can have some fast mana, as a treat.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The One Ring is Banned</strong></h3>



<p>Printed in the powerful The Lord of the Rings: Tales of Middle-earth set, The One Ring has proved itself as a key card advantage engine and inevitable threat in Conquest. The card draw ability, despite its appreciable downside, warrants comparison to some of Conquest&#8217;s most potent legal cards and some banned cards. The indestructible and protection abilities make it difficult to interact with via typical means. Being a colorless artifact makes it viable in any deck, which means it harms deckbuilding diversity across the format. As with Mana Vault, affordability concerns also affect The One Ring. Overall, The One Ring opposes many of the format&#8217;s goals.</p>



<p>The Balance team decided that The One Ring is a net detriment to the format, and is banning the card. We recognize that the watch list was not used in this instance; with a more regular update schedule, the Balance team commits to using the watch list more proactively to signify concerns about cards such as this.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Burgeoning and Exploration are Unbanned</strong></h3>



<p>The December 2021 update, which was the last time cards were added to Conquest&#8217;s ban list, was largely focused on curbing the effect of Green- and lands-based strategies in that metagame. That update, which affected Hullbreacher and 5 powerful Green cards, including Exploration and Burgeoning, overall had the desired impact on those strategies. However, in the two years since, the Balance team has considered these two enchantments as key pieces that could be the first to be unbanned in Conquest. Land ramp strategies, particularly involving Primeval Titan and/or Sylvan Primordial, have still shown up in the past couple of years, but they made concessions in the early game, because they were without these powerhouse enchantments. As the metagame shifted, Green lost ground.</p>



<p>The Balance team believes Burgeoning and Exploration provide interesting reasons to choose a commander with Green and compelling deck building options within. Notably, they come with important deck building requirements, don&#8217;t make mana on their own, and are usually dead draws in the late game. They are not nearly as centralizing as other December 2021 ban alumni. For those reasons, the Balance team is walking back bans on both Burgeoning and Exploration by unbanning them now.</p>



<p>While unbanning one while leaving the other banned was considered (they are slightly different cards after all), the Balance team decided that moving both these cards, and any future cards that are unbanned, to the watch list, is the right choice. In the event that the Balance team makes a mistake with an unban, they reserve the right to ban the card once more.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Goblin Recruiter is Added to the Watch List</strong></h3>



<p>Goblin Recruiter is being added to the watch list due to consistently threatening early wins, especially in combination with the commander Muxus, Goblin Grandee. Its effect of tutoring many Goblins in a specific order is cumbersome to resolve, which can be problematic for event play. This ability, and, to a lesser extent, the win conditions it sets up, can be difficult to stop. Goblin Recruiter supports Red, currently the consensus best color in Conquest, but within that single-color identity, it could potentially be a detriment to archetypal diversity.</p>



<p>Unlike with the other commander-and-win-condition pairs on the watch list, the Balance team decided simply to watchlist Goblin Recruiter, as it is more clearly the problematic outlier between the two cards. (Other watch list options from this deck were also considered.) The Balance team reserves the right to add Muxus in the future to the watch or ban list.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Tivit, Seller of Secrets and Time Sieve are Added to the Watch List</strong></h3>



<p>Tivit, Seller of Secrets as a commander, especially in combination with Time Sieve, is a major outlier in the Conquest format. Tivit&#8217;s Ward 3, flying, and six power and toughness make a regular and steadfast commander damage threat. Time Sieve combines Tivit&#8217;s token creation ability with the format&#8217;s guideline to play with four players to effectively recreate Time Vault combos and take the remainder of the game&#8217;s turns. Taken together, this commander-and-combo-piece pair stands out as a threat to the health of the format. This outlook has a statistical basis in the Brazil metagame, where Tivit and Time Sieve together have a staggering play and win rate.</p>



<p>The Balance team wants to see how these statistical outliers perform in the absence of Mana Vault before taking further action.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ancient Tomb is Added to the Watch List</strong></h3>



<p>In light of the Mana Vault ban and Burgeoning and Exploration unbans, and the Balance team&#8217;s continued monitoring of fast mana and land strategies, Ancient Tomb is being put on notice. Conquest&#8217;s 30 life total is seemingly not low enough (compared to Commander) to prevent this ubiquitous land card from having an outstanding impact on the format. Green-based decks with Burgeoning, Exploration, and Crop Rotation are poised to take the most advantage of Ancient Tomb, but any deck with 2-mana artifacts or large generic commander costs can benefit from the extra mana, too. Ancient Tomb also suffers from being a scarce and expensive card, harming deck construction and tournament affordability.</p>



<p>As with Mana Vault, the Balance team wants the community to weigh in on this card while it&#8217;s under this close scrutiny. More feedback around the new watch list items will be collected in 2024.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Watch List Pruning</strong></h3>



<p>The Balance team is removing the following from the public Watch List:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>The &#8220;Partner&#8221; Mechanic</strong></li>



<li><strong>Flawless Maneuver</strong></li>



<li><strong>Deadly Rollick</strong></li>



<li><strong>Obscuring Haze</strong></li>



<li><strong>Prophet of Kruphix</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>These may be revisited in the future, but for now the Balance team believes their presence in the format is not detrimental. Especially with respect to Partner, the Balance team will likely address problematic outliers with individual ban-as-commander actions, instead of neutralizing the entire mechanic.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>

</ul>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Update Conclusion</strong></h3>



<p>With two cards banned and two cards unbanned, and several changes to the watch list, the Conquest Balance team hopes this rebalancing will more closely align the format’s parameters and metagame with our goals. Beginning in 2024, the Balance team will strive to release a format update at least twice annually. Although Conquest is still in its beta period, we want to see it grow and flourish, and regular updates are an important part of that goal.</p>



<p>We appreciate the patience and dedication the community has shown our burgeoning format and hope that we can all continue to enjoy the game going into 2024. We hope to have a few more organized play events this year. If you have interest and are capable of supporting our team with this in some capacity, reach out to an admin or mod! Keep an eye out for announcements regarding an official website, and online organized Conquest play returning in 2024. Thanks for reading and happy Conquesting!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Summary: The Scry Rule becomes official; no banlist changes.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>The Scry Rule is officially implemented.</strong></li>



<li><strong>No changes to the banlist.</strong></li>



<li><strong>Esper Sentinel</strong> is watchlisted.</li>



<li><strong>Cyclonic Rift</strong> is watchlisted.</li>



<li><strong>Malcolm, Keen-Eyed Navigator and Glint-Horn Buccaneer</strong> are watchlisted.</li>



<li><strong>Krark, the Thumbless</strong> is watchlisted.</li>



<li><strong>Underworld Breach</strong> is watchlisted.</li>
</ul>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Scry Rule Becomes Official</strong></h3>



<p>Conquest inherits Commander’s base ruleset and mechanics, with some changes. That list of changes grows today, by implementing <strong>&#8220;the Scry rule&#8221;:</strong></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>During the start of game procedure, after taking mulligans (CR 103.4) and before taking pregame actions (CR 103.5), each player who is not first performs Scry X, where X is the number of players acting before them in turn order. This rule only affects games with more than two players.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Support for this rule has been overwhelming, with the vast majority of survey respondents polling in favor of the rule. We hope that it will continue to offer strategic opportunities to players acting later in turn order and to help balance games of Conquest further.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Esper Sentinel is Watchlisted</strong></h3>



<p>Since its printing in Modern Horizons 2, Esper Sentinel has proven to be a highly played creature across archetypes. Its triggered ability is comparable to banned cards Rhystic Study and Mystic Remora, and while it triggers only once per opponent per turn, Esper Sentinel can come out as early as turn 1 and lasts until it is removed. We are monitoring how this card impacts multiplayer game balance and flow.</p>



<p>Smothering Tithe raised similar concerns in the last balance update, but Esper Sentinel is showing up more often and therefore the more impactful card. Smothering Tithe is now removed from the watchlist.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Cyclonic Rift is Watchlisted</strong></h3>



<p>Cyclonic Rift has long been a staple interaction card in multiplayer settings. In particular, the asymmetrical Overload ability has powerful applications on top of the flexible two-mana mode. It is played in virtually every blue deck.</p>



<p>Cyclonic Rift is on the Balance team’s radar for its impact on long games in events. Cyclonic Rift overloaded can cause games to lengthen, especially if the caster does not have the ability to close out the game. We want to be sure that this card is not causing too many draws in events.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Malcolm, Keen-Eyed Navigator and Glint-Horn Buccaneer are Watchlisted</strong></h3>



<p>Malcolm, with access to Glint-Horn Buccaneer, has torn through the recent Conquest event scene. While Partner as a mechanic is already on the watchlist, Malcolm sets itself apart as a generic value Partner commander, with access to an efficient combo, if Red is included. When backed up by a bevy of fast mana and cheap interaction, this combo can be hard to stop.</p>



<p>The Balance team is keeping a close eye on this combination, especially in the context of a possible change to Partner and other multiple-commander mechanics.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Krark, the Thumbless is Watchlisted</strong></h3>



<p>Krark’s triggered ability, in the context of an optimized deck, creates prolonged play sequences and rules headaches. Krark, alongside Sakashima of a Thousand Faces and other pieces that grant additional Krark triggers, may present too sticky a quagmire for event play. While Krark promotes a unique and viable strategy, we want Conquest events to run smoothly, and this commander’s storm turns can oppose that goal.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>No Changes to Multiple Commander Mechanics … Yet</strong></h3>



<p>With Malcolm and Krark joining Jeska and the Partner mechanic itself on the watchlist, the Balance team is strongly considering taking action on multiple commander mechanics. Crucially, the question of whether to keep banning commanders or to change rules for the whole group has not been answered satisfyingly. (See the previous format updates about Partner for more information.)</p>



<p>The release of Commander Legends: Battle for Baldur’s Gate heralds a new iteration of this mechanic, which will likely impact a sweeping change to the rules regarding multiple commanders. We want to give players the opportunity to test this new mechanic, as well as potential changes to multiple commander mechanics, before a new rule becomes set in stone. Look for more information about this testing in the near future.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Underworld Breach is Watchlisted</strong></h3>



<p>The issue Underworld Breach presents is two-pronged. On the one hand, Underworld Breach itself is the driving force behind a multitude of infinite combo lines. This by itself is not currently considered problematic as all of these Breach combos require at least two other cards, e.g. Lotus Petal + Brain Freeze, Stitcher&#8217;s Supplier + Culling the Weak, Birgi + Burning Inquiry. On the other hand, Breach also provides one of the strongest recursion tools in the game. Especially in late-game scenarios, resolving Breach often gives the player who does so multiple chances at going for a win after they had already been stopped earlier in the game.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the way these two aspects intertwine and feed into each other also creates gameplay sequences that are difficult to counteract. Breach combines well with cards like Jeska&#8217;s Will to essentially become both the setup and its own combo. There are many situations where Breach, when used in conjunction with one other card, will allow players to see enough of their deck to find the missing piece to go infinite proper. This pattern of using itself to extend into combo wins that also involve Breach is both unique and uniquely powerful in this format.</p>



<p>We currently believe that any deck can have enough access to counterplay in the form of graveyard hate, removal, counterspells, and/or Rule of Law effects to deal with Breach. On top of that, Breach can only fulfill its combo-extending function when coupled with a card that fills the graveyard in some way. Lastly, certain bans in Conquest (e.g. Demonic Tutor) have removed some of the most egregious play patterns associated with Underworld Breach in other formats.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Full Conquest Watchlist</strong></h3>



<p>We&#8217;ve taken a look at discussions here on the Conquest Discord and the data from our most recent survey. As a result of that, we made a few additions to our Watchlist. These cards were also added to the list in hopes of continuing the discourse surrounding them and coming to a collective understanding of their place in our format.</p>

<li><strong>Fierce Guardianship (and the Commander 2020 free spell cycle)</strong></li>



<li><strong>Smothering Tithe</strong></li>



<li><strong>Prophet of Kruphix</strong></li>
</ul>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>



<p>Hey @everyone,</p>



<p>First off, we’d like to welcome Savannah to the Conquest Balance team! Savannah has been an active and involved member of the Conquest community for a long time, and the unique insights they have brought to our balance discussions have opened up a wide range of new considerations for the format, some of which are also reflected in this format update. This is also the first ban update that was made with specific input from our testing team. Their contributions did a lot in helping us figure out which specific cards we should target with bans and which areas we should focus our attention on going forward.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Banlist Updates</strong></h3>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Green Cards</strong></h4>



<p>Green has been the most represented and successful color in Conquest since the format’s inception. This is due to a combination of factors:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Mana acceleration and mana fixing</li>



<li>The best tutors for creatures or lands</li>



<li>The strongest board presence</li>



<li>Some of the best interactive options</li>



<li>A wide range of card advantage options</li>



<li>Resilience, due to strong recursion and redundancies</li>



<li>The most flexible color overall</li>
</ul>



<p>In short, Green can do too much too fast and too consistently, and it can do so without having significant drawbacks. While we want to preserve some of the strengths of Green, we want to make its color identity in Conquest more focused and distinct from other colors. To accomplish this, this update shifts Green’s access to mana acceleration more towards creatures, which provides clearer avenues for interacting with Green’s mana to other colors. In addition to making this aspect of Green more focused, we want to adjust its efficient tutors to be more in line with other colors. Lastly, Sylvan Library is one of the strongest card draw and card selection spells in the format, which becomes excessive in a color that already has so many strong options.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Sylvan Library is Banned</strong></h4>



<p>While we initially believed that Sylvan Library could be fine in a format with 30 life, other aspects of the card emerged that made it problematic. First, there’s the aforementioned general strength of Green; Sylvan Library infringes on the Black share of the color pie. On top of that, even if you didn’t pay Life into Sylvan Library, Commanders that let you dig through your library or provide consistent shuffle effects further exacerbated the card selection aspect of its strength. The third key aspect that made Sylvan Library problematic is that it’s a highly splashable card that would always be an auto-include in any deck that gets access to Green. Setting aside the mechanical baggage of tracking cards drawn each turn to resolve its effect, Sylvan Library is too exceptionally powerful for the format.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Eldritch Evolution is Banned</strong></h4>



<p>Eldritch Evolution is one of the most efficient and flexible tutor options in Green. One factor is that it lets players “cheat” on mana early in the game while also being a tutor (as showcased in situations where a 1-mana dork is turned into something like Circle of Dreams Druid or a 3-mana creature into something like Prophet of Kruphix). Its interaction with sacrificing Commanders which can easily be brought back from the Command Zone nullifies what’s supposed to be one of its central drawbacks. Furthermore, its flexibility allows players to get any creature that costs X + 2 or less. This aspect of the card made it a bit too strong at letting Green players adjust to any given gameplay situation.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Finale of Devastation is Banned</strong></h4>



<p>Finale of Devastation combines too many strengths in one card. It’s an efficient tutor, there are no restrictions on which creatures it can find, it’s a reanimation spell in Green, and it’s a win condition via combat. Uniting all of these aspects in one card, and thus one single deck slot, contributes too much to Green’s flexibility and resilience.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Burgeoning is Banned</strong></h4>



<p>This ban was made with two considerations in mind. First, as mentioned prior, we want to focus Green’s access to efficient mana acceleration on creatures to be more interactive. On top of that, Burgeoning is another card that made Green overly flexible. Having Burgeoning in your opening hand allows you to keep those 5-land hands that you would have to mulligan otherwise, and actually be rewarded with an explosive start for doing so. It benefits from the multiplayer nature of Conquest in a way that advantages it disproportionately to the cost of including it in your deck, and is especially egregious when combined with Commanders that provide further card advantage.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Exploration is Banned</strong></h4>



<p>Exploration showcases many of the factors that made Burgeoning problematic while also allowing for more explosive plays on Turn 1. Compared to any mana dork, Exploration is a card that scales extremely well into the mid and late game, which provides Green with an even higher degree of flexibility, resilience, and consistency. Consideration was given to keeping Exploration in the format while banning Burgeoning, but both cards individually do too much.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Hullbreacher is Banned</strong></h4>



<p>This is probably the least surprising part of the Banlist update. Hullbreacher is miserable to play against, disrupting too much with its static effect. It combines too well with cards that efficiently strip hands, replacing opponents’ card draw with Treasures. Flash circumvents many common ways of interacting with creatures, especially in a color that already has a wealth of instant-speed interaction. Access to such a strong effect should come at a higher deckbuilding cost and the card itself should also be more interactable. In that sense, cards like Leovold, Emissary of Trest or Narset, Parter of Veils are more in line with what we have in mind for Conquest.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Watchlist Updates</strong></h3>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Fierce Guardianship (and the Commander 2020 free commander spell cycle)</strong></h4>



<p>While Fierce Guardianship is the standout spell, it might be indicative of an underlying mechanical issue with these free spells. Unlike other interactive spells that can be cast for no mana, these come at no real cost. Since Conquest is meant to be a more commander-centric format, getting free spells for something you already want to be doing could prove to be too centralising. For instance, Fierce Guardianship, when combined with cheap commanders that helm faster combo decks, can protect those combos a bit too easily. On the other hand, these spells may also serve an important positive function in making players more comfortable to tap out for more expensive mid and late game Commanders. We’re currently unsure whether these aspects are in balance or the scales are tipped towards the more problematic side, so we’re going to keep an eye on them going forward.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Smothering Tithe</strong></h4>



<p>Smothering Tithe can turn its early deployment into an explosive Midgame, similar to the aforementioned Green land drop enchantments. It exploits the multiplayer aspect of Conquest in ways that are reminiscent of banned cards like Mystic Remora and Rhystic Study. Another factor here is similar to what we mentioned with regards to Sylvan Library: it’s a highly splashable card due to its 3W Mana cost. Its relatively high initial mana cost and the option to pay mana instead of giving your opponent a Treasure token, coupled with the prevalence of cards like Collector Ouphe, mean that we don’t currently feel the need to ban it, but it is a card we’re monitoring.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Prophet of Kruphix</strong></h4>



<p>Lastly, we are observing Prophet of Kruphix as an engine piece that could be too powerful in conjunction with different strategies and commanders. As the metagame develops in the wake of this update, we’re paying close attention to this card and those decks, to decide whether further changes are needed.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Looking Ahead</strong></h3>



<p>The Conquest Balance Team has identified five key focus areas for improvement for our format in 2022.</p>



<ol start="1" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Command Zone Mechanics:</strong> We’ll discuss the nature of the Command Zone, including Partner and its related mechanics, individually outlying commanders, possible changes to Companion, and other designs that care about Commanders.</li>



<li><strong>Turn Order Balance:</strong> We will collect data on how much of an advantage or disadvantage turn order conveys and investigate possible rules changes to restore balance.</li>



<li><strong>Green Representation:</strong> We will continue to monitor color pie harmony and Green’s representation in competitive play, with further adjustments possible.</li>



<li><strong>Land Card Usage:</strong> We will examine Land ramp, utility Land usage, and healthy interaction with Lands in Conquest.</li>



<li><strong>Accessibility and Enjoyment:</strong> We will consider how Conquest information and play can be made more accessible, and evaluate individual cards for how cumbersome they are for players.</li>
</ol>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Partner Mechanic</strong></h3>



<p>We’re aware that there are currently several problematic Commanders, with Jeska, Thrice Reborn being the most prominent example. However, we acknowledge that we’re going to get more Partner Commanders in the future. There’s already a large number of Partner Commanders represented on the banlist, which indicates that the issue may be related to the mechanic itself rather than just individual outliers.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Factors of Concern:</strong></h4>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Having access to two creatures in the Command Zone</li>



<li>Easier access to a wider range of colours</li>



<li>Incremental value from recasting Partner Commanders multiple times</li>



<li>Individual Partners often outperform other commanders in their colors</li>



<li>Compounding effects of speed, consistency, resiliency, and versatility</li>
</ul>



<p>We’re considering long-term solutions to the Partner mechanic and are opening a channel on the Conquest Discord (#partner-suggestions) for player input. We’re also exploring a Beta Test league to test potential changes to the mechanic.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Open Beta Test for the Scry Rule</strong></h3>



<p>Since we’ve recently started considering more fundamental rules changes for Conquest, we want to encourage everyone to test the following rule:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Before starting the game, after mulligans, but before pre-game actions, the players who are not first in turn order get to Scry X, where X is equal to their position in turn order minus 1. (The second player gets to Scry 1, the third player gets to Scry 2, and the fourth player gets to Scry 3.)</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We’d like to collect feedback, data, and impressions for this potential rules change before we discuss actually implementing it during our next balance meeting. We will be releasing another survey to gather your thoughts.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p>That’s all for now! Thank you all so much for sticking with us, brewing for and playing Conquest, and contributing to this wonderful format. We wish you all happy holidays and a wonderful new year. We’re super excited to see where Conquest is going to go in 2022, and we hope you’re all along for the ride.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Summary: Banned as Commander list now includes Inalla, Archmage Ritualist, Rograkh, Son of Rohgahh, and Yuriko, the Tiger’s Shadow.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Banned as Commander</strong></h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Inalla, Archmage Ritualist</strong></li>



<li><strong>Rograkh, Son of Rohgahh</strong></li>



<li><strong>Yuriko, the Tiger’s Shadow</strong></li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Added to Watchlist</strong></h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Jeska, Thrice Reborn</strong> (by herself)</li>



<li><strong>The Partner mechanic</strong></li>
</ul>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Inalla, Archmage Ritualist is banned as commander.</strong></h3>



<p>The discussion of this change is based on two questions:</p>



<ol start="1" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Why did Inalla (the deck) need to be banned?</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>Inalla being able to present a win from an empty board for merely 2UB that only requires finding one card &#8211; Spellseeker &#8211; is too fast and too consistent for Conquest. While one-card combos are fine in Conquest, those combos should come with a certain degree of commitment/investment. Inalla’s Spellseeker combo costs very little mana to execute, does not require any prior setup, while also only requiring one card. Another compounding factor is that the Spellseeker combo gains resiliency from the very cards it uses for its combo line. A reanimation spell on Spellseeker after the first attempt is stopped is all that’s required to go for another attempt. In this sense, other one-card combos in Conquest involve more “risk.” This also means that counterspells and instant-speed exile effects are the only reactive spells that can actually stop the combo. The last factor that made the combo problematic is that it’s more tutorable than any other combo in Grixis colours.</p>



<ol start="2" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Why is Inalla (the card) banned instead of one of the combo pieces?</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>We discussed several options for how the deck could be preserved by nerfing the combo, such as banning Finale of Promise or Burnt Offering. We also considered banning Spellseeker to prevent that particular combo line while still making it possible to play Inalla. However, none of these cards are problematic in any other decks. Especially when we consider potential future printings, we had concerns that Inalla would be a deck we might have to return to and potentially adjust bannings for from time to time. These factors indicate that the problem lies with Inalla herself rather than any of the individual combo pieces, so she had to go.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Rograkh, Son of Rohgahh is banned as commander.</strong></h3>



<p>Having a free creature in the Command Zone that’s also a Partner is a bit too much. Rograkh is a free enabler for Mox Amber, Culling the Weak, Infernal Plunge, and Springleaf Drum among other cards. The cards outlined here made it so decks with Rograkh often had access to several more mana accelerants and ritual effects than other decks in the format. This ended up breaking the way in which we approach balancing cards like Ad Nauseam for Conquest. While we like having these cards in the format, the way we keep them in check is by giving creature-heavy and Commander damage decks a chance to pressure the Ad Nauseam player before they can resolve that spell. This is one of the reasons why a significant amount of both tutors and fast mana is banned in Conquest. Rograkh decks, in particular the Rakdos and Grixis builds, were able to cast spells like Ad Nauseam, Bolas’s Citadel, and Peer into the Abyss on turns 2 and 3 far too consistently. Unfortunately, a free creature in the Command Zone provides too much potential for abuse.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Yuriko, the Tiger’s Shadow is banned as commander.</strong></h3>



<p>Yuriko is a commander that is very cheap to deploy, while also being very quick to threaten life totals and gaining massive card advantage while doing so. This makes her similar to Pako &amp; Haldan, but on top of all of these factors, she is also problematic on another axis. Her Commander ninjutsu ability not only keeps her cheap during the entirety of the game, but it also makes her more resilient than most other commanders against most removal. This means that Yuriko will often dictate the pace of the game to the point where three other players teaming up against Yuriko won’t be enough to stop her in a meaningful way. All of these factors come together to create a very oppressive deck that is threatening during all stages of the game, being able to win very early while also being able to grind out a slow victory without much of an issue.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The common factor between these bans</strong></h3>



<p>Inalla’s effect is available for “free” by simply having her in the Command Zone. Rograkh is a literal free creature in the Command Zone. Yuriko, while not completely free, can always be deployed for 2 mana as long as you’re able to attack with a creature, no matter how many times she has been interacted with over the course of the game. These three cards have shown that having free or consistently cheap effects in the Command Zone has the potential to be problematic for the pace of the game. In Inalla’s case, it’s easy access to a cheap, fast, consistent, and resilient combo. In Rograkh’s case, it’s easy access to an enabler for multiple strong mana accelerants. In Yuriko’s case, it’s easy access to a resilient, fast clock and a strong card advantage engine. While not all free/consistently cheap effects in the Command Zone are problematic, those that come with significant advantages will likely be subject to scrutiny going forward.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Jeska, Thrice Reborn is on the Watchlist (by herself).</strong></h3>



<p>While we were initially keeping a close eye on the combination of Jeska and Kraum, Jeska herself might prove to be the real problem, and we’re changing her Watchlist status to reflect that. With this series of bans, we’re concerned that various Jeska builds may end up taking over the Conquest metagame. Being an asymmetric board wipe, a commander damage enabler, and a combo outlet unites a lot of advantages in one card.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Partner mechanic is on the Watchlist.</strong></h3>



<p>Partner commanders always equate to starting with an extra card in your hand while also gaining access to more colours. While there are many Partner pairings where this is not problematic, it has the potential to become an issue once those Partners provide advantages in an efficient manner. Conquest has already seen a fair deal of bans of Partners where this is the case. We’re going to keep a close eye on this trend and investigate it further. For now, it’s unsure whether we’re ever going to take action on this, but we’re going to pay increased attention to the impact of the Partner mechanic on the format. Feedback from the community will be crucial for this topic even more than for any other item on this list. Let’s make the exploration of and conversation about Partner commanders a regular topic of discussion because the more feedback we get on it, the better. Every opinion and impression is important to us, and we’d love to hear yours, both now and as time goes on.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Banned</strong></h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Drannith Magistrate</strong></li>

</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Banned as Commander</strong></h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">

<li><strong>Haldan, Avid Arcanist</strong></li>

</ul>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Drannith Magistrate is banned</strong></h3>



<p>We’ve given Drannith Magistrate enough time to shine in Conquest, and by now it’s clear that the card has several compounding issues that ultimately lead to our decision to ban it. Firstly, we noticed that it became more and more apparent that the correct thing to do when your Commander had White in their colour identity was to dedicate one of your slots to Drannith Magistrate. While staples are fine and this isn’t too problematic per se, it combines with some other aspects of the card that make it incompatible with Conquest:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Drannith Magistrate has a disproportionately low mana and setup cost for how much of an effect it has on many decks in the format.</li>



<li>Green decks are once again the main benefactors thanks to their ability to easily tutor for creatures.</li>



<li>High-CMC commanders already have a slight disadvantage in Conquest, and Drannith Magistrate further exacerbates that issue by giving the Magistrate player more turns to find and deploy the card.</li>



<li>Drannith Magistrate was designed as a counter to Companions, so it also hitting Commanders to such an extent was unintended.</li>



<li>On top of Commanders, Drannith Magistrate also serves as coincidental hate against other strategies.</li>



<li>We think that having many commander-centric decks in the format is healthy and one of the standout features of Conquest.</li>



<li>Even for decks that want to play their Commander early, it was often correct to play an early Drannith Magistrate instead due to the massive tempo advantage it generates.</li>



<li>Drannith Magistrate can often lead to Catch-22 situations when it comes to deciding what to use your spot removal on. Is it correct to remove the Magistrate so you can play your game or is it correct to remove the opponent’s commander that might kill you across a few turn cycles? More often than not, neither of those choices are good. This leaves only board wipes as a reasonable answer to decks that can abuse these types of play patterns.</li>



<li>Due to the prior point, some colours are heavily disadvantaged when trying to interact favourably with Drannith Magistrate.</li>
</ul>



<p>All of these factors come together to create not just many frustrating play experiences, but also a card that we think doesn’t line up well with the goals we want to pursue with Conquest. As a result of this, we decided to say goodbye to Drannith Magistrate.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Jeweled Lotus is banned</strong></h3>



<p>While Jeweled Lotus is comparable to Mana Vault when it comes to 5-cmc commanders, we found its play patterns especially problematic for 3- and 4-cmc commanders. Simply having Lotus in the deck will increase the likelihood of a Turn 1 commander play in these decks by about 10% before accounting for mulligans. Lotus also doesn’t come with any sort of setup cost. It’s 0 mana to deploy, which allows some decks to pursue their game plan as normal while also deploying their commander for “free.” A simple example would be a Yisan player with Jeweled Lotus in their opening hand. Before Lotus, the deck was aiming at deploying a Turn 2 Yisan with a high degree of consistency. With Lotus, the deck can deploy a Turn 1 Yisan while also casting a mana dork, Wild Growth, etc., essentially catapulting the deck ahead by a full turn cycle every time it has Jeweled Lotus in its opening hand. For several Conquest decks, this is simply way too powerful when compared to the cost of one deck slot and a potentially mediocre draw later on in the game.</p>



<p>Another one of our goals with Conquest is to provide a more consistent play experience, which cards like Jeweled Lotus run counter to. While some amount of variance is good for creating interesting games, this card simply provides way too much of it.</p>



<p>The final point in favour of banning Jeweled Lotus is that we’re happy with the amount of fast mana that’s currently available in the format. Some of the pieces we have, such as Chrome Mox and Mana Vault, have the potential to create exciting plays for some decks (think cantripping into a crucial Chrome Mox when you’re on your last legs during a tight Storm turn). Jeweled Lotus doesn’t provide any of those opportunities while also increasing the amount of available fast mana overall, which is something we are currently not comfortable with.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Kinnan, Bonder Prodigy is banned as Commander</strong></h3>



<p>Kinnan just does it all. He’s in the best colours in our format, his effect is really powerful at every stage of the game, he’s a combo piece, and he’s an infinite mana outlet, all in one. On top of this list of things, there are two main factors that lead to our decision to ban the card. Kinnan is a 2-cmc commander. Especially given how his ability lends itself to being built around in a way where decks run more mana sources than normal, we found that Kinnan would almost never become prohibitively expensive to cast. Even if he was removed two or three times, the Kinnan player would still be able to re-cast their commander without much of an issue. It often felt like removing Kinnan wasn’t even much of a setback for the Kinnan player. This also plays into the second main factor behind our decision. On top of being very explosive, Kinnan didn’t have much good counterplay. The commander’s high replayability coupled with access to Blue for additional protection made it a very fast deck that was also resilient enough to frequently mount strong comebacks. This pushed it a bit above the power level we intended for Conquest, so Kinnan will be banned as commander.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Haldan, Avid Arcanist is banned as Commander</strong></h3>



<p>In effect, this is meant as a ban of the Pako &amp; Haldan deck. This deck could easily get away with dedicating all of its slots to ramp, interaction, and extra turn effects. Pako turns into a lethal threat very quickly and continues to grow as the game goes on, which further accelerates its clock. That quick growth, coupled with the high amount of card advantage gained through Pako and access to counterspells, made it so the deck was very difficult to interact with while also being very quick to bury its opponents in card advantage and defeating them shortly thereafter. Pako was able to consistently out-pace most other decks in the format, so it had to go.</p>



<p>The way we decided to go about this was to ban Haldan, Avid Arcanist as Commander. We liked the idea of giving people access to Gruul Pako as a commander damage deck. This deck will still be able to deploy an early Pako and threaten quick kills with a growing commander, but it won’t be able to generate card advantage through Pako, it will be significantly worse at protecting itself, and it will have to find ways outside of extra turns to gain additional combat steps.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Kraum, Ludevic’s Opus &amp; Jeska, Thrice Reborn are on the Watchlist</strong></h3>



<p>This combination of Partner commanders provides a way to immediately kill one player at the relatively low cost of 8 mana, entirely from the command zone. We’re concerned about the high consistency and resiliency of such a strategy, and having access to the high-quality interaction and protection suite of Blue might lead to a deck that’s slightly too powerful. Another concern we have is that the deck itself might follow a similar pattern as Haldan &amp; Pako, where the entire deck can consist of ramp and interaction without needing to dedicate at least a number of slots to closing out the game.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Commander damage-related concerns</strong></h3>



<p>One trend we have noticed with recent Commander-related printings is that WotC seem to be looking into ways to make powerful combat damage commanders that are scaled towards the 21 damage requirement of Commander. Given that the commander damage requirements of Conquest are significantly lower at 12, this trend might prove to be problematic in the long run. We’re going to keep a close eye on new printings to see whether the trend continues and we’re going to discuss potential format changes to address it.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Mana Vault is on the Watchlist</strong></h3>



<p>We’re comfortable with the current position of Mana Vault in the format, but as new cards get released, Mana Vault will often be the first card on our minds when thinking about how those new cards are going to interact with our format. With this in mind, it’s a card that will likely be watchlisted for a long time to come.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p>That’s all for now. We hope that we could provide appropriate reasonings for each of the changes we made. Your feedback and support is what keeps this format going, so let’s work together to make it the best multiplayer Magic experience it can be!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Summary: Dockside Extortionist banned. Culturally insensitive cards removed. Commanders dying now trigger "dies" abilities.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Banned</strong></h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Dockside Extortionist</strong></li>



<li><strong>Crusade</strong></li>



<li><strong>Stone-Throwing Devils</strong></li>



<li><strong>Pradesh Gypsies</strong></li>
</ul>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p><strong>Commanders dying now trigger &#8220;dies&#8221; abilities.</strong></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Dockside Extortionist is banned</strong></h3>



<p>As much as we love our most wily goblin, he exerts a fairly centralizing force between the extreme mana acceleration and unmatched combo potential. In the future, we may take a look at allowing for a glorious return, but for now, this gives other strategies more breathing room to grow.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Commanders being put into the graveyard from the battlefield trigger “dies” abilities before returning to the Command Zone</strong></h3>



<p>Conquest inherits from the base Commander ruleset; the &#8220;Commander dies&#8221; change is subsequently also adopted by Conquest.</p>



<p>The new rule (a state-based action [SBA]) that governs this interaction says:<br>“If a commander is in a graveyard or exile, and was put there since the last time SBAs were checked, its owner may choose to put it in the Command zone.”</p>



<p>This means a commander first goes to the graveyard, triggering abilities (of itself or other cards which say “Whenever X dies”), then goes to the command zone. This only applies to the graveyard and exile — the replacement effect remains in effect for zones like the hand or library, so the commander will never arrive in those zones.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Wizards removed some culturally offensive cards from constructed Magic</strong></h3>



<p>Conquest will be following suit. The Conquest administration and community stand against racism and xenophobia in all forms.</p>



<p>The following cards are now banned:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Crusade</strong></li>



<li><strong>Stone-Throwing Devils</strong></li>



<li><strong>Pradesh Gypsies</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>The following cards are already illegal in Conquest:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Cleanse</strong></li>



<li><strong>Imprison</strong></li>



<li><strong>Invoke Prejudice</strong></li>



<li><strong>Jihad</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>That&#8217;s all for this update! A big thank you to everyone here for supporting Conquest.</p>
